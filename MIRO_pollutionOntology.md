==============

----



## A. Basics

### A.1 Ontology name

Sporting Activities and Pollution Ontology

### A.2 Ontology owner

Sonia Ben Ayed (sonia.ben_ayed@telecom-sudparis.eu) - Telecom SudParis
\n
Fabiola Espinoza (fabiola.espinoza_castellon@telecom-sudparis.eu) - Telecom SudParis

### A.3 Ontology license

No license


### A.4 Ontology URL

https://github.com/fabiola-espinoza-castellon/ontology-project/blob/master/PollutionApp.owl


### A.5 Ontology repository

https://github.com/fabiola-espinoza-castellon/ontology-project



## B. Motivation

### B.1 Need

This ontology has been created to reduce the exposure to different kinds of pollution while people
perfom outdoor activities. The aim of the ontology is to propose different kinds of paths to the
user in order for him to not be exposed to the pollutions and to choose the environment where he
wants to do his activity. 

### B.2 Competition
The paper "AIR_POLLUTION_Onto: an Ontology for Air
Pollution Analysis and Control " describes an ontology ofr air pollution analysis and control. This paper is more focused on academical applications, whereas we wanted to build an ontology for daily information and user-friendly.
See https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-0221-4_17.pdf

### B.3 Target audience

The community for which the ontology was created is a wide community. It takes into account all
types of users wanting to perform sport activities (from teenagers to older people).

## C. Scope, requirements, development community

### C.1 Scope and coverage

The fields of interest of the ontology are sports and environment, well-being. 


### C.2 Development community

The ontolgy is developed by Sonia BEN AYED and Fabiola ESPINOZA CASTELLON.

## D. Knowledge acquisition

### D.1 Knowledge acquisition methodology

The requirements of the ontology have been defined by the group by brainstorming they key areas
of interest aswell as the desirable features of such an ontology. 

### D.2 Source knowledge location

To realize this ontology, we plan to gather real-time pollution levels across the world, with geolocation references. This data can be found in https://waqi.info/ brought by the World Air Quality Index.



## E. Ontology content

### E.1 Knowledge Representation language
Owl version 3.0.3 

### E.2 Development environment
Protégé


### E.3 Entity metadata policy

Each entity is defined by a natural language definition.


## F. Managing Change

### F.1 Sustainability plan 
The ontology will not be actively maintained and developed

### F.2 Entity deprecation strategy 

No class is deleted from the ontology but obsolete classes will be annotated.


## G. Quality Assurance

### G.1 Testing

The ontology was successfully classified by the reasoner HermiT 1.3.8 (i.e., is logically consistent) in less than 1 second. All classes in the ontology are satisfiable.

### G.2 Evaluation

The ontology meets its stated requirements and goals. 
### G.3 Example of use
Examples of use can be seen in our report as queries.
